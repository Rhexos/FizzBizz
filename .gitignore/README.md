# FizzBizz
My personal example of the FizzBizz challenge.


Running the file will produce lines that show:
  The number that follows one of the three parameters
  If it is divisible by 3, it will print "Fizz"
  If it is divisible by 5, it will print "Buzz"
  If it is divisible by 3 and 5, it will print "Fizz Buzz"
